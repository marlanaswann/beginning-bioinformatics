#No AI use on Rosalind #1, #2, #8

# AI Use Log - Rosalind #3
- Tool/model & version: Gemini (Built into Colab latest version)
- What I asked for: An automatic error : Gemini error told me: TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable; 
- Snippet of prompt(s): This error insinuates I was missing something that Colab could loop. It prompted me to assign a variable named "odd_sum = 0"
- What I changed before committing: I went to chat GPT to further explore this error and why it would want me to do this. (See next entry)
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): (I went to chat GPT to further explore this error.)


# AI Use Log - Rosalind #3
- Tool/model & version: Chat GPT 5
- What I asked for: I asked Chat GPT what is Odd_Sum and how to use that to complete adding the sum of my odd numbers in the code I had generated so far. 
- Snippet of prompt(s): "What is += doing and is odd_sum a built in command?" and "So how would I use this for the code I've generated here: ros_range = 201 for number in range(ros_range): if number % 2 == 1: odd_sum"
- What I changed before committing: I assigned odd_sum = 0  and then added: odd_sum += number and print(odd_sum) on lines 5 and 7 respectively. 
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): I checked my code by removing the faulty parts and runnning the code. It produced a list of all the odd numbers. I added the new functions and it produced a sum. My answer was correct on first attmept with Rosalind. I know now I can subsitute any value for the range function and the code should run the same for odd related problems.

# AI USE Log - Rosalind #4
- Tool/model & version: Chat GPT 5
- What I asked for: I gave Chat GPT the code I had developed so far: With open ("rosalind 4 example file.txt", "r") as data:Rosalind_text = data.readlines() #print ("".join(rosalind_text)) for line in rosalind_text: print ("".join(rosalind_text[])) if line [] % 2 = 0. I then asked it to help me fix my code for only showing even lines 
- Snippet of prompt(s): "Help me fix this code. I am doing the following task A file containing all the even-numbered lines from the original file. Assume 1-based numbering of lines and I need help finding a command that will count the even lines :with open ("rosalind 4 example file.txt", "r") as data: rosalind_text = data.readlines() #print ("".join(rosalind_text)) for line in rosalind_text: print ("".join(rosalind_text[])) if line [] % 2 = 0
- What I changed before committing: I added a variable called individual and used the command enumerate as well. While I had the "if line % 2 = 0 , I had to go back and add line to prior lines where it was left off (as line was not assigned) and then edit it to: if individual % 2 == 0:. I also added the r.strip command at the end to get rid of extra lines.
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): I ran parts of code until they were successful, added the changes that AI helped me to incorporate, and then asked Chat GPT to explain rationale behind all added AI steps.

# AI USE Log - Rosalind #5
- Tool/model & version: Chat GPT 5 & Gemini (Colab latest version)
- What I asked for: I asked for help to split the dictionary and print.
- Snippet of prompt(s): "What can I add to this code to count occurrences?"
- What I changed before committing: I added "print(word)" which was assigned a variable, I added word_count = {} ; to create a empty dictionary to store count. Gemini also gave me this feedback that I incorporated:he primary error is the incorrect way of incrementing the count in step 6 (word_counts += 1 instead of word_counts[word] += 1). Fixing this would resolve the SyntaxError and allow the code to attempt the word counting logic correctly.
  else: # This else needs to be aligned with the if
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): I verified correctness by performing this code on sample data first, and additionally asked Chat GPT to explain each step and why it was used.

- # AI Use Log - Rosalind #6
- Tool/model & version: Chat GPT 5
- What I asked for:I asked for help storing my file into an object that can also read it. From thereI was able to use the count function and also ask Chat GPT how I can integrate the count function using the code I had so far. 
- Snippet of prompt(s): "How can I use fix this code so I count every word in this file: with open ("rosalind_ini6.txt", "r") as story: ros_count = story.read() print(story.count)"
- What I changed before committing: I fixed my object name and added it in place of the word "story". I also added - unique_words = set(words) to help get only distinct words in the count and "for word in unique_words: print(word, words.count(word))" to print the word and number side by side for each unique count.
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): I verified correctness by first ensuring my code for reading the file and printing was correct using sample data. After adding the Ai changes, I had chat GPT break down the rationale for the new commands and show me different examples with other practice set data. 


# AI Use Log - Rosalind #7
- Tool/model & version: Gemini(Built into Colab)
- What I asked for: I asked for help with the error in my code. This error occcured due to me trying to perform a Biopython function on an object that I had not converted to become a Seq object. 
- Snippet of prompt(s): I asked it to "explain the error in my code".
- What I changed before committing: I converted the string I read from the file into a Biopython Seq object and then applied the transcribe() method.
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): I verified correctness by reading through the rationale, running parts of the code to see if it was working, and then re-used parts of the code to continue further testing for other problems.

# AI Use Log - Rosalind #9
- Tool/model & version: Gemini (Colab latest version)
- What I asked for: I asked it to help troubleshoot the closed file error in my code.
- Snippet of prompt(s): I clicked "Fix error" and it promppts an explanation.
- What I changed before committing: It helped me initialize a variable to store the highest GC content as well as a variable to use in my â€œif" statement for later . It also helped me create the if statement for "if gc_content> highest_gc_content" then set the variables we made equal to each other (highest_gc_content and highest_gc_id). Finally, it helped me to print both of those - the ID and highest GC content.
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): I verified correctness by running a sample file and comparing the manual calculations to the output.
